CSE 3724 has nand2tetris. CSE 3724 project 4 is the same as cannon project 6. CSE 3724 project 5 is cannon project 4. CSE
project 6 is cannon project 5. CSE project 7 is not of other because it uses Macroassembly which is not cannon. Macroassembly
is better than high level language because high level langauge is redundant we already learned it before. The last project in CSE 3724
is project 8 which has Stack, Operator, Procedure, Multiply, Divide, Fibonnaci. It is too simple. There needs to be more. Multiple 
and Divide runs on exponential time. Also macroassembly.py is very bad. Debugger.c does macroassebly and also debuggs, tests, and compare.
Compiles to bytecode which ends in byteasm. Debugger.c is not a compatible hack assembly because it makes sure that ROM can 
be infinite as long as none of the files exceeded 32767 lines. Debugger.c is backwards compatible with hack.
